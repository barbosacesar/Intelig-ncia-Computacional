# Facial Emotion Analysis with LibreFace

This repository contains a facial emotion recognition interface powered by the `DeepFace` library and implemented in Python. It supports image uploads, ZIP batch analysis, and webcam capture directly in Google Colab. The system processes facial expressions and returns the dominant emotion with confidence metrics and visualizations.

## üöÄ Features

* Upload support for `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, or `.zip` files containing images
* Webcam capture for real-time analysis (Google Colab only)
* Emotion prediction using pre-trained DeepFace backbones (VGG-Face, Facenet, OpenFace, etc.)
* Interactive HTML tables and bar chart visualizations
* Aggregated emotion statistics from multiple inputs (image batch or video frames)
